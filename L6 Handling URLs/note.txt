URL = uniform resource Locator

after ? in url there are parameters like 
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tic+tac+toe+


by default there no anything which recognise the parameters in URLs hence we use external package
go to npmjs.com

for installing URL package ------>>>>>  npm i url

#if we deleted a package accidentally or we havent node_modules packages 
we have to run ---->> inp install
package.json dependencies get automatically installed


"+" === is space
"&" === use to separate parameters
